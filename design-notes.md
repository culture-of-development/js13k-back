Backprop

Essentially I want it to be something like:
- you're the game manager but you dont control everything
- thinking team fight tactics
- support multiple strategies
- single player, needs to be some AI for the opponent
- dungeon crawler so to speak


Your brain is your tower.  The brain has 3 parts, the backprop, the left brain and the right brain.  

Backprop
The backprop is responsible for improving the other 2 parts of the brain.  At any given point, it can only be training one side or the other.  It trains the selected side by intervention of the user who clicks on the side they want to be actively training.

Each side of the brain can control up to 2 units, based on level.  So you can control up to 4 possible units total.  Units can only be controlled by one side or the other and each unit has a basic attack and a special.

Left brain
The left brain is the analytical side.  Strategy traits: Planning, problem solving and ...

Right brain
The right brain is the creative side.  Strategy traits: Intuition, Understanding and ...


The game advances by building out your team, then squaring your team off against your opponent's team.  This fight happens without intervention from the user.

As your left and right brain level up, your units get stronger?

randomly presented 3 units in the buy window after each level, likelihood of seeing units dependent on your overall level
units have 2 traits each, like class and specialization
units have 2 skills each, basic and special
units can only be controlled by left or right brain
classes can only be controlled be either the left or right brain
no 2 units with the same specialization can share the same class, and it should be that the same specialization can only exist on opposite sides of the brain
specialization pairs are more powerful than class pairs
you should only be able to achieve 3 pairs
there is a set pool of units both you and your opponent share, loser chooses first, you get a random common unit to start with
3 qualities of units, common, rare and epic
there are lots of common, fewer rare, and only 1 each of the epics
